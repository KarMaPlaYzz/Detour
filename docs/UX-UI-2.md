UX Design Challenge Brief: Simplifying Detour Selection
1. Project/Challenge Background
Detour transforms navigation into discovery by giving users routes optimized for curiosity, not speed. The current challenge lies in the detour selection experience: users hesitate or drop off when faced with too many options, unclear value, or too much setup friction. The goal is to make selecting a detour feel intuitive, delightful, and—most importantly—effortless.
2. Project/Challenge Goals
Reduce friction and cognitive load during detour selection.
Make the process feel emotionally aligned with exploration and serendipity.
Create a first-time experience that immediately demonstrates value (“Wow, I found this place because of Detour!”).
Increase conversion from “opened app” → “started a Detour route.”
3. Key Performance Metrics
Time to first Detour generated (target: < 60 seconds).
Drop-off rate before route generation (target: < 20%).
% of users who start a second Detour within 48 hours.
Emotional resonance (qualitative): Post-detour feedback using emojis or micro-surveys.
4. Target Audience
Urban explorers, tourists, and locals seeking novelty in their daily routines.
Age: 18–45.
Shared mindset: curious, experience-driven, and willing to trade efficiency for meaning.
5. Device Choice Options
Start with mobile web or hybrid app for MVP testing.
Future: full native mobile experience with location-based triggers and ambient storytelling.
6. Suggested Tasks
Redesign the detour selection screen to require no typing and no reading-heavy menus.
Introduce visual storytelling elements to each detour option.
Prototype an onboarding flow that automatically generates one detour with minimal input (“Surprise me” mode).
Explore motion design or micro-interactions to convey a sense of discovery.
Test three selection paradigms:
Emotion-first: pick by vibe (Romantic, Mysterious, Playful).
Location-first: pick by neighborhood or distance radius.
Randomizer: spin a wheel or shuffle to get a spontaneous detour.
7. Guiding Questions
How might we make choice feel playful instead of burdensome?
What visual or tonal cues signal that Detour is about wonder, not efficiency?
How can the first detour feel like a reward, not a tutorial?
What’s the simplest, most delightful way to express the value of “taking the long way”?
How can Detour’s UI behave like a companion, not a GPS?
8. What This Challenge Is Designed to Teach and Improve On
Crafting emotionally resonant UX flows.
Balancing minimal cognitive load with meaningful engagement.
Applying behavioral design principles (choice architecture, anticipation, delight).
Designing for serendipity and exploration within structured systems.
