UX Research Plan: Validating the Detour Selection Experience
1. Research Objectives
We’re not here to philosophize about exploration; we’re here to make sure people can actually use Detour without needing a map for your map app.
Here’s what you need to learn fast:
How easily can users understand what Detour does within 10 seconds of opening it?
Can they select or start a detour in under one minute?
Do they feel the process is fun, or like they’re filling out a tax form?
Does the vibe-based selection approach resonate emotionally?
What elements trigger genuine curiosity or excitement?
2. Key Research Questions
How do users interpret the idea of a “detour” before any explanation?
At what point in the flow do users hesitate or get confused?
Which selection paradigm works best—emotion-first, location-first, or randomizer?
Do users perceive the extra time added to their route as “worth it”?
Which visual or micro-interaction best communicates “discovery”?
3. Research Methods
a. Guerrilla Usability Testing (Low-Fidelity Phase)
Participants: 8–10 users in coffee shops or co-working spaces, ages 18–40.
Assets: Paper sketches or clickable Figma wireframes.
Tasks:
“You’re meeting a friend across town—try taking a detour.”
“Pick a detour that matches your mood.”
“Preview and start your detour.”
Metrics: Time to task completion, confusion points, verbal reactions.
Observation goal: Track moments of hesitation or laughter—both matter.
b. Remote Unmoderated Testing (Mid-Fidelity Phase)
Tool: Maze, Useberry, or Lookback.
Participants: 20–30 globally, diverse cities.
Metrics: Click paths, completion rate, drop-offs, emotional ratings (emoji sliders).
Outcome: Quantitative validation of ease and engagement.
c. Diary Study (Real-World Exploration Phase)
Duration: 1 week.
Participants: 10 local explorers testing Detour outdoors.
Task: Use the app once per day; record notes, photos, or voice memos about what they discovered and how they felt.
Data goal: Emotional and behavioral insights—do users feel wonder or just annoyance when they’re late to work?
d. A/B Testing (Post-MVP Launch)
Test Variables:
Onboarding type (random detour vs. vibe selection).
Visual framing (photo-based vs. illustrated POIs).
Reward feedback (confetti vs. badge).
Metrics: Engagement time, return rate within 72 hours, route completion.
4. Success Metrics
Metric	Target	Why it matters
Time to first detour	< 60 sec	Onboards users fast
Drop-off before route start	< 20%	Measures friction
Positive emotional reaction	> 80%	Validates “joyful inefficiency”
Repeat use within 48 hrs	> 30%	Indicates stickiness
POIs shared or added	> 1 per 3 users	Builds community loop
5. Participant Profiles
Persona	Description	Motivations
Urban Explorer	Lives in the city, loves hidden gems	Wants to rediscover their city
Cultural Tourist	Traveler seeking authenticity	Avoids “tourist traps”
Creative Commuter	Bored of routine	Wants to make daily life more interesting
Date Planner	Uses Detour for experiences	Wants novelty and atmosphere
Each persona will reveal different friction points—for example, commuters need clarity on time cost, while explorers prioritize novelty.
6. Deliverables
Usability report: Screenshots, task success rates, annotated quotes.
Journey map: Emotional highs and lows across the flow.
Iteration plan: Ranked list of design changes with effort/impact estimates.
Prototype v2: Adjusted flow based on validated insights.
7. Research Insights Expected
Emotional framing (vibe-based entry) will outperform categorical input.
First 20 seconds of the experience determine retention.
Playful micro-interactions (animation, humor) directly correlate with NPS improvements.
POI previews need richer storytelling to sustain curiosity.
