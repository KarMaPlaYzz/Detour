# DETOUR UX/UI BLUEPRINT
## Part 5: Copy & Tone Guidelines

---

COPY & TONE GUIDELINES

Detour's voice is conversational, warmly witty, and unapologetically human. Copy avoids corporate jargon, robotic precision, and false urgency. The tone prioritizes curiosity, encouragement, and delight. Users should feel like they're being guided by a knowledgeable friend who shares their sense of adventure.

---

TONE PILLARS

Curious, Not Prescriptive
  The app invites discovery rather than commanding action. Copy suggests possibilities rather than dictating outcomes.
  Example (Do): "Ready to find something unexpected?" vs. (Don't): "Start navigating now."
  Example (Do): "Wander this way?" vs. (Don't): "Proceed to the next waypoint."

Warmly Witty, Never Corporate
  Humor is gentle and approachable, not forced. Wordplay and levity emerge naturally from the situation.
  Example (Do): "That vibe is being finicky. Try another?" vs. (Don't): "An error has occurred. Please retry."
  Example (Do): "You've found something special." vs. (Don't): "POI successfully reached."

Respectful of Agency
  Users choose; they are not passive consumers. Copy acknowledges their autonomy.
  Example (Do): "Skip this one if it's not your thing." vs. (Don't): "You must visit all POIs."
  Example (Do): "Take as long as you like." vs. (Don't): "Maintain pace to reach destination."

Celebratory, Not Boastful
  Success moments are acknowledged with genuine warmth. Celebrations feel earned, not artificial.
  Example (Do): "You've had quite the journey." vs. (Don't): "Congratulations on your exceptional performance."
  Example (Do): "Three coffee stops? We'd do the same." vs. (Don't): "Optimal social engagement recorded."

Accessible & Inclusive
  Language is simple, jargon-free, and respectful of diverse abilities and backgrounds.
  Example (Do): "You're offline. Previous detours are available." vs. (Don't): "Network connectivity unavailable. Cached data mode enabled."
  Example (Do): "Skip this POI" vs. (Don't): "Ignore waypoint."

HEADLINE & CTA COPY

Welcome Screen

  Primary Headline: "Where to?"
  Rationale: Open, inviting, assumes agency. Three words; instantly understood.
  Alternative (if narrative context needed): "Ready to wander?" or "Find your next detour."

  Subheading (Optional): "Choose a vibe. Find the magic."
  Rationale: Telegraphs the app's core mechanism (vibe selection → magical discovery).
  Alternative: "Your mood. Our route."

  Primary CTA: "Start a Detour"
  Rationale: Active, positive verb. "Detour" is the app name; reinforces brand identity.
  Alternative: "Begin exploring" (less brand-specific, but equally clear).

  Secondary CTA: "Browse My Detours"
  Rationale: Straightforward; acknowledges that users may have previous experiences to revisit.
  Alternative: "My Routes" or "Past Adventures" (more playful, but longer).

Transport Mode Selection

  Section Header: "How are you traveling?"
  Rationale: Conversational; acknowledges different modes and preferences.
  Alternative: "Choose your pace" or "Pick your method."

  Option Labels: "Walking," "Cycling," "Driving"
  Rationale: Simple, direct; no jargon.
  Descriptions (Optional):
    Walking: "Discover every detail. Slower pace, more POIs."
    Cycling: "Balance between pace and discovery. Medium range."
    Driving: "Cover more ground. Fewer, farther-apart POIs."

  Confirmation CTA: "Next" or "Let's Go"
  Rationale: "Next" is neutral progression; "Let's Go" is more playful and inclusive.

Vibe Selection

  Section Header: "What's your vibe?"
  Rationale: Casual, first-person; invites self-expression.
  Alternative: "Show us your vibe" or "Pick a mood."

  Subheading: "Help us tune your detour."
  Rationale: Indicates that the vibe choice influences the experience; emphasizes personalization.
  Alternative: "This shapes everything that follows."

  Vibe Option Copy (Examples):

    Creative: "Galleries, studios, and unexpected design."
    Rationale: Specific (venues/types); evokes curiosity.
    Alternative: "Art, design, and creative spaces."

    Foodie: "Markets, cafés, and hidden eats."
    Rationale: Sensory ("eats"); specific venues; hints at discovery ("hidden").
    Alternative: "Restaurants, cafés, and culinary gems."

    Nature Escape: "Parks, trails, and green corners."
    Rationale: Varied terrain; "green corners" is poetic and suggests hidden pockets of nature.
    Alternative: "Forests, parks, and outdoor beauty."

    History Buff: "Museums, monuments, and stories."
    Rationale: Tangible + narrative ("stories"); invokes depth.
    Alternative: "Historical sites and cultural landmarks."

    Nightlife: "Bars, venues, and evening energy."
    Rationale: Energetic language ("energy"); specific venue types; implies time-of-day.
    Alternative: "Nightclubs, bars, and late-night culture."

    Hidden Gems: "Secret spots locals love."
    Rationale: Intrigue ("secret"), community ("locals"), endorsement ("love").
    Alternative: "Undiscovered places known to insiders."

    Local Favorites: "Community favorites and gathering spots."
    Rationale: Inclusive ("community"), warm ("favorites"), social ("gathering").
    Alternative: "Where locals gather and celebrate."

  Skip Option: "Skip" or "Surprise me"
  Rationale: "Skip" is direct; "Surprise me" invites serendipity.
  Secondary text: "Or let us pick for you."

  Confirmation CTA: "Confirm," "Sounds good," or "Let's go"
  Rationale: All are positive; "Sounds good" is conversational; "Let's go" is action-oriented.

Route Preview

  Section Header: "Your Detour"
  Rationale: Possessive ("Your"); reinforces personalization.
  Alternative: "Your Adventure Awaits" (more dramatic).

  Summary Text (Example): "23 min walk | 1.2 km"
  Rationale: Compact; includes transport mode implicitly (walk, cycle, drive).
  Alternative: "Walking 1.2 km in about 23 minutes."

  POI List Header: "Points of Interest" or "What You'll Find"
  Rationale: "Points of Interest" is functional; "What You'll Find" is narrative and inviting.
  Alternative: "Stops Along the Way" (friendly, contextual).

  Example POI Snippet: "Hidden rooftop gallery with indie installations"
  Rationale: Specific details (rooftop, indie); sensory (gallery); builds intrigue.
  Alternative: "An intimate rooftop art space."

  Primary CTA: "Begin Detour"
  Rationale: Action verb; brand reinforcement; matches previous CTAs.
  Alternative: "Start Exploring" or "Let's Go."

  Secondary CTA: "Adjust Route"

  Alternative: "Regenerate" or "Try a Different Route" (more explicit).

  Rationale: Gentle; gives users agency without forcing a decision.
  Alternative: "Keep This One" or "Bookmark."

  Alternative: "Skip This" or "Next POI."

  Approaching POI Prompt (Example): "Look for the blue door on your left"
  Rationale: Specific, actionable, uses sensory language.
  Alternative: "You're almost there. Watch for the ornate blue entrance."

  POI Arrival Prompt (Example): "This café opened in 1962. Still serves the original espresso blend."
  Rationale: Storytelling; specific historical detail; creates connection to place.
  Alternative: "A neighborhood institution for over 60 years."

  Offline Mode Message: "You're offline. Previous detours are available."
  Rationale: Factual; provides reassurance (previous data available); friendly tone.
  Alternative: "No internet connection. Cached routes are ready."

Arrival & Reflection

  Section Header: "You've arrived!"
  Rationale: Celebratory exclamation; acknowledges the journey.
  Alternative: "Mission accomplished." (less warm) or "Welcome home." (more poetic).

  Rationale: Emotional, open-ended; invites introspection.
  Alternative: "Rate your experience." (transactional, avoid).

  Rationale: Emphasizes mutual learning; not transactional feedback.
  Alternative: "Your thoughts shape future detours." or "This helps us improve."

  Journey Stats (Example): "You traveled 1.2 km in 23 minutes | 7 POIs | 3 photos"
  Rationale: Specific, metric-driven; celebrates engagement.

Error & Offline States

  Route Generation Failed: "That vibe is being finicky. Try another?"
  Rationale: Playful; acknowledges the issue without technical jargon; offers solution.
  Alternative: "Hmm, that combo isn't working. Want to try a different mood?"

  POI Data Unavailable: "Not enough interesting spots nearby. Try a wider area?"
  Rationale: Helpful; suggests action; avoids blame.

  GPS Signal Lost: "We've lost sight of you. Reconnect GPS?"

TONE VIOLATIONS TO AVOID

  "Please" (except in rare, formal contexts; feels robotic).
  "Error" or "Failure" (use conversational language; e.g., "That didn't work").
  "User" (use "you" instead; more personal).
  Exclamation points in every sentence (one or two per screen maximum).
  Vague language ("Loading...", "Processing..."; be specific).
  False urgency ("Act now!", "Limited time!"; antithetical to Detour's pace).
  Jargon ("API", "sync", "geolocation"; use simple language).
  Passive voice (prefer active: "Check your GPS" vs. "GPS should be checked").

---

TONE CHECKLIST FOR WRITERS

  Is the language conversational and warm?
  Would a friend say this, or only a corporation?
  Does it respect the user's agency and intelligence?
  Is it specific, not vague or generic?
  Does it avoid jargon or explain technical terms?
  Is it action-oriented (when needed) without being pushy?
  Does it acknowledge emotion and context?
  Is the tone consistent with the app's brand?
  Would the copy work equally well in light and dark modes?
  Is it accessible, clear, and jargon-free?
