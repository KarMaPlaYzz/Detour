Detour UX Flow: From App Open → First Adventure
1. Entry Point: “I Just Opened the App”
Objective: Hook the user instantly. No cold starts, no walls of text.
Design principle: Show, don’t ask.
Flow:
Splash screen shows the tagline:
“Go the long way. Find what others miss.”
Immediate transition to a subtle motion background—a map fading into small pins labeled “Hidden Café,” “Rooftop Mural,” “Old Clock Shop.”
One bold CTA: “Take a Detour.”
Secondary, smaller text link: Choose your vibe.
Rationale: Start users with a playful bias toward action, not configuration.
2. “Choose Your Vibe” Screen
Objective: Let users express intent emotionally instead of categorically.
Design principle: Decision = micro adventure, not questionnaire.
UI Concepts:
Large, tappable cards with illustrated emotions or icons:
🔮 Curious
🖤 Romantic
🔥 Adventurous
🎭 Artsy
☕ Chill
🎲 Surprise Me
Each card animates slightly on hover/tap—like a ripple of excitement.
Next action:
After a card is chosen, fade into a short 2–3 second animation:
“Finding your perfect detour…” with pins appearing dynamically on the map.
3. “Preview Your Detour” Screen
Objective: Show the payoff before commitment.
Design principle: Visualize the experience, not the logistics.
UI Concepts:
Simplified route map showing the base route + “detour highlights” as glowing waypoints.
Each waypoint has a tiny photo or emoji tag (“🥐 Café,” “🎨 Mural,” “👻 History”).
Subtle stats:
“Adds 12 min to your trip.”
“3 points of interest.”
“Estimated smiles: 7.” (playful tone reinforces brand personality)
Actions:
[Start My Detour] – main CTA.
[Shuffle Again] – secondary action for a new route with same vibe.
4. “On the Way” Mode
Objective: Keep users engaged during travel.
Design principle: Serendipity in motion.
UI Concepts:
Clean, map-first screen with minimal overlays.
Ambient prompts like:
“Look left—you’re passing a mural painted by locals.”
“Want to pause here? Hidden café 50m away.”
Option to capture and share discoveries (“Add to Detour Map”).
Behavioral Design Layer:
Positive reinforcement through discovery streaks or badges, but never turn it into a grindy gamification loop. Curiosity should feel rewarded, not farmed.
5. “Arrival & Reflection” Screen
Objective: Turn the end of a route into the beginning of community.
Design principle: Reflection sustains engagement.
UI Concepts:
Simple screen showing route summary: “You discovered 3 places.”
Prompt:
“Found something amazing? Add it for future Detourers.”
Shareable visual recap (auto-generated map snapshot).
6. Information Architecture Summary
Stage	User Goal	UX Objective	Primary UI Element
Entry	Curiosity	Inspire exploration	“Take a Detour” CTA
Vibe Selection	Express mood	Reduce choice complexity	Emotion cards
Preview	Evaluate route	Show value visually	Map + Detour Highlights
On the Way	Explore	Keep user engaged	Ambient prompts
Arrival	Reflect & contribute	Build community loop	Route recap screen
7. Key Usability Hypotheses
Reducing typing input to zero will decrease abandonment rates by at least 30%.
Emotion-first entry points will improve first-route engagement and retention.
Map-first visualization will strengthen comprehension of the “Detour concept” faster than text-based explanations.
Subtle delight moments (animations, humor, small rewards) will increase user satisfaction and app stickiness.
