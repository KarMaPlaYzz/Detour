1. Problem Statement
Users are excited by the idea of a “detour,” but they face cognitive overload when choosing one. They don’t yet understand what makes a detour “worth it,” and scrolling through lists of random POIs feels more like research than discovery.
2. Goal
Reduce friction in the Detour selection process so users can get to their first “wow” moment in under a minute. In UX terms: minimize decision effort, maximize delight.
3. Root Causes (likely)
Choice paralysis: too many detour themes or POIs.
Lack of contextual previews: users can’t easily visualize how their route will change.
Unclear value differentiation: “Why this detour?” isn’t obvious.
Unnecessary manual input: typing in interests or categories feels like a form, not an adventure.
4. UX Solutions
Here’s a ladder of improvements—from quick wins to deep UX rethinks:
Quick Wins
Interest Chips: Replace long forms with tappable chips (“Art,” “Cafes,” “Nature,” “Weird Stuff”). Chips = instant gratification.
Smart Defaults: Auto-suggest a detour theme based on time of day or weather (“Evening Chill Walk,” “Rainy Day Art Crawl”).
One-Tap Preview: Before generating the route, show a simple visual—an animated map line zigzagging toward curiosity.
Mid-Level Improvements
Detour Mood Selector: Instead of lists, use emotional entry points—“Surprise me,” “Romantic,” “Curious,” “Haunted.” This uses emotional framing to guide choice.
Mini Stories: Each detour could start with a one-line story teaser:
“Follow the ghosts of Soho’s jazz past.”
“Discover three murals even locals miss.”
Micro-stories reduce abstraction and increase desire.
Big UX Leap
Detour Wheel (Gamified Selector): A circular UI element where users spin to get randomized, themed detours near them. The unpredictability fits the “serendipity” brand.
Adaptive Onboarding: First-time users are guided through one spontaneous detour instead of a menu—show, don’t ask. Afterward, then let them customize.
5. UX Metrics to Track
Time from app open → detour selected.
Abandonment rate before route generation.
Number of repeat detour sessions per user per week.
NPS after first use (target: +40 or higher).
