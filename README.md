# Detour

## Core Concept
A navigation app that optimizes for the most interesting route, not the fastest. The user inputs a destination and their interests (e.g., "Architecture," "Street Art," "Hidden Cafes," "Spooky History"). Detour then generates a route that might take 15 minutes longer but guides them past fascinating, crowd-sourced points of interest, turning a mundane trip into a micro-adventure.

## Viral Hook
Serendipity & Discovery. The hook is the promise of breaking your routine and discovering the hidden world right under your nose. The viral content is the amazing things people find. Every user becomes a micro-explorer, sharing photos of the "cool mural" or "secret garden" that Detour helped them find on their way to the grocery store.

## Target Audience
Curious urban dwellers, tourists who want an authentic experience, and anyone who is bored of the same daily commute.

## Monetization Model
*   **Freemium:** Basic Detour generation is free.
*   **Curated Detour Packs:** Sell premium, themed "Detours" curated by local experts for a one-time fee ($3.99). Examples: "The 'Secret Speakeasy' Bar Crawl" in New York, or "The 'Brutalist Architecture' Walk" in London.
*   **Local Business Sponsorship:** A small, independent bookstore or cafe can pay a small fee to become a suggested "Point of Interest" on relevant Detours, driving real foot traffic.

## Competitive Edge
While Google Maps is ruthlessly efficient, Detour is purposefully inefficient in the name of joy and discovery. It serves an emotional need, not just a logistical one. It gamifies local travel in a way no other navigation tool does.

## MVP Version
A React Native app for iOS and Android where a user inputs a start and end point. The app queries a database of user-submitted points of interest and adjusts the route to pass by one or two of them.

## Expansion Potential
Could integrate with audio guides that automatically play when you approach a point of interest. It could host "Detour Challenges" where users compete to find the most new places in their city in a month. It could become the go-to platform for experiential travel and local discovery.
